## 0.14.0:
- New: `openInPendingState` config. When enabled, open new location in pending state(preview mode). Thank you @aviatesk! #48

## 0.13.2:
- Fix: mini editor was inappropriately saved as history and cause runtime exception. Now fixed.

## 0.13.1:

## 0.13.0:
- Improve: Tune flash duration from `0.5ms` to `0.8ms`.
- Internal: Overhaul code for explicitness, readability #45.
- Apply standard linter, code format rule #44.
- Improve: `ctrl-o`, `ctrl-i` history navigation for column change within same row.
  - It was not idempotent since `ctrl-o` add new entry and invalidate entry with same row.
  - But now no longer destroy entry `ctrl-o` add case, so `ctrl-o`, `ctrl-i`, `ctrl-o` return to same position at same row.

## 0.12.0:
- New: Save history for unsaved editor #38
  - Previously cursor-history package maintain cursor position history for the editor which have filePath on disk.
  - From this version, remember history for temporal editor while that editor is alive(not be destroyed).
- Maintenance: Convert all code from CoffeeScript to JavaScript #35
- Improve: Destroy duplicate entry(same position and same filePath) before jump.
  - This situation happens when whole editor content was replaced such as `atom-prettier` package.
  - This means `prettier:format` invalidate all history in that buffer.
  - This invalidation is correct behavior from cursor-history package's stand point, keeping duplicate entries in history is worse.
- Support: Engine Atom v1.19.0 and above.

- New: History serialize/deserialization with normal Atom's serialization mechanism #33
  - Thus history is maintained per project not per Atom-wide.
- Meta: Add following tags in `keywords` section of package.json for better findability.
  - `jumplist`, `history`, `navigation`
