  # History concatenation mimicking Vim's way.
  # newEntry(=old position from where you jump to land here) is
  # *always* added to end of @entries.
  # Whenever newEntry is added old Marker wich have same row with
  # newEntry is removed.
  # This allows you to get back to old position(row) only once.
  #
  #  http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#jump-motions

  # e.g
  #  1st column: index of @entries
  #  2nd column: row of each Marker indicate.
  #  >: indicate @index
